# Introduction

PropShow Kit is a collection of extended components specifically built for **[Shadcn Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)**. It provides a series of UI components that are not yet included in the official Shadcn Vue library but are very practical in actual business development.

## Design Philosophy

PropShow Kit follows the same design philosophy as Shadcn Vue:

- **Not a Component Library**: It is not a dependency package installed via npm.
- **Copy and Paste**: You have full control over the code. Simply copy the component source code directly into your project to use it.
- **Highly Customizable**: Built on Tailwind CSS, you can modify styles and logic as needed.
- **Unified Style**: Default styles are consistent with Shadcn Vue, seamlessly integrating into your existing projects.

## Why Do You Need It?

When developing projects with Shadcn Vue, we often encounter requirements for common components that are not provided by the official library, such as:

- **Status Badge**: A badge with a status indicator dot.
- **Inline Tip**: An inline alert box for documentation or tips.
- **Copy Button**: A button with copy feedback.

PropShow Kit aims to fill these gaps, saving you development time by not having to write these components from scratch.

## Key Features

- 🎨 **Shadcn Style**: Maintains visual style and API design consistent with Shadcn Vue.
- 📋 **TypeScript**: Written entirely in TypeScript, providing good type hints.
- 🌙 **Dark Mode**: Perfectly supports light and dark mode switching.
- 🧩 **Independence**: Components are decoupled as much as possible, so you can choose only the components you need.
